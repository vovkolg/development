# Usage: 
# 
#       Properties set in this file may use the full property
#       name. For example:
#                  
#             <service_pid>.<property_key>=<property_value>



# Note: 
#
#       Properties in configuration files are subject to a delay
#       as they rely on the config-admin and fileinstall bundles.
#
# Format: 
#       type character followed by a quoted string representation of value. 
#          e.g a boolean -  property=B"true"
#       Lowercase type character implies primitives. Type can be omitted for String.
#       Types:
#           T = String            I = Integer            L = Long
#           F = Float             D = Double             X = Byte
#           S = Short             C = Character          B = Boolean
#
#       Array format is property=<type>["<value1>","<value2>"]. 
#           e.g. array of int - property=i["1", "2", "3"]
#       A backslash may be used to break up the line for clarity.

# path name of the clone URI is used, "default" is used if there is no path.
com.ge.dspmicro.gitrepository.clone.path=""

#
# User name for authentication if needed when accessing the repository.
# Credentials can be passed in the URI also by "prepending" the address with username:password@.
#   https://username:password@yourcompany.com/git/project
# Anonymous can be used for projects that allow read access to everyone. No "credentials" need to be passed in this case.
#   https://anonymous@yourcompany.com/git/project
#
com.ge.dspmicro.gitrepository.credentials.username=""
